Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happe
ns to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

1.  Who are you, my warranty?!
2.  We're rescuing ya.
3.  WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!

### This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Soothe us with sweet lies. No, I'm Santa Claus!

- I love you, buddy!
- That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.
- What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… We're also Santa Claus! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!

I'm Santa Claus! So, how 'bout them Knicks? File not found. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.

You can see how I lived before I met you. Guess again. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Why did you bring us here? And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Bender, we're trying our best. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Daylight and everything.
